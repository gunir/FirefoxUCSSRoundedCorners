This method creates rounded corners without modifying the #appcontent at all, it creates pseudo corners using 2 pseudo content elements
So zero speed penalty, at all
And it works on zen-browser.app even if this website is using backdrop-filter, because it's not a part of #appcontent
And another big plus, mouse scroll works even if you place mouse pointer past scrollbar
People have complained about the above issue too, the only way was removing the rounded corners using Disable Rounded Corners Theme, but now you don't need to do that anymore
